# WyzeHub

This is an _unofficial_ Hubitat implementation for Wyze devices. The app offers basic control over supported devices and device groups.

## Supported Devices
Support is currently limiited to devices I have on hand. Devices will be added as I get them or as the community contributes.

## To be implemented...

* Device Group Update - currenttly after a device group is added, changes to device membership in Wyze are not reflected in Hubitat.

## Troubleshooting

### Auth Issues

  * 2FA *should* work. If you have issue authenticating using 2FA, disable 2FA on your Wyze account and re-enable after connecting WyzeHub.
  * Token refreshing still isn't perfect, and Wyze also seems to randomly flag tokens with a rate limit. 
    * If your devices stop working, it is likely due to a token issue. Check the log for errors.
    * To resolve auth issues, simply re-enter your usename and password in the App settings. This will initiate a new token request.

   1. It will likely be best to do your work against the `vNext` branch.
   2. Name the device something so to be accurate and recognizable (i.e. 'Camera v2' vs 'Camera v3')
   3. Take care to follow formatting, code styling, and general "code feel" as best as possible.
   4. Keep the same license (if submitting back to this repo).
3. Test the hell out of your code.

## Credits and High Fives

The following GitHub repos were of great help in the development of this package:

* 🐍 [shauntarves/wyze-sdk](https://github.com/shauntarves/wyze-sdk): Unofficial Wyze SDK in Python. Used quite a bit as a reference for this libray.
* 🏡 [ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op](https://github.com/ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op): Wyze Homebridge driver. I initially started updating this driver to add support for the Color Bulb. Quickly got frustrated with Homebridge and decided to abandon that effort for this one.
* ☕ [HubitatCommunity/CoCoHue](https://github.com/HubitatCommunity/CoCoHue): Used extensively as a reference for Hubitat app and driver development.
* 🔑 [amrishraje/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-v3](https://github.com/amrishraje/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-v3): Used as a reference for adding Wyze Lock.
